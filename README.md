- IDE: Netbeans

# All features
NetBeans was made open source by Sun Microsystems, which remained the project sponsor until January 2010 when Sun Microsystems became a subsidiary of Oracle.

Throughout its history in Sun Microsystems and Oracle, NetBeans has been free and open source and has been leveraged by its sponsor as a mechanism for driving the Java ecosystem forward.

In 2016, Oracle donated the NetBeans source code to the Apache Software Foundation. In April 2019 Apache NetBeans became a top level Apache project. Please see our History section for more information.
